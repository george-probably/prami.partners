## Frequently Asked Questions

> **What is Prami Partners?**  
Prami Partners is an exchange group for [omg.lol members](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/georgeprobably). Keep an eye out, there's more coming soon!

> **What is special about Photo Partners?**
Unlike the first Prami Partners event, this is fully digital! All you need is an omg.lol account, and the willingness to take some photographs!

> **Is Prami Partners a dating site?**  
No! I promise the blue and pink hearts are just a coincidence caused by the fact that Prami is pink and Snappy-Tech is blue. Since we're here, please remember not to be weird.

> **What will you do with my info?**  
Honestly, I don't want to keep hold of it either. It will all be deleted 3 months after entries close.
