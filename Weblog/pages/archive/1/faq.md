## Frequently Asked Questions

> **George, this is your first Prami Partners event; how do you know what we'll ask?**  
Good question. I just kind of guessed; if you have any actual questions, reach out to [pramipartners@omg.lol](mailto:pramipartners@omg.lol)

> **What are the key dates?**  
Here's what you need to put in your diary:  
22nd of Jan: Registrations Open  
29th of Jan: Registrations Close  
1st of Feb: Prami Partners are sent out to those who signed up  
10th of Feb: Final recommended shipping date  

 
> **What if I find the perfect item, but it's $31/â‚¬31?**  
Obviously, I cannot police the guide pricing, but it's just that: a guide. Please be considerate that some Prami Partners may be uncomfortable receiving a gift with a large monetary value. 

> **I want to take part, but I can't afford the $30/â‚¬30 guide price plus shipping. What do I do?**  
I totally get it. Prami Partners isn't about the monetary value of the gifts, so if you think of the perfect gift and it's only $15/â‚¬15, that's still great!  
Furthermore, thoughtfulness is much more important than monetary value. Does your Prami Partner have a cat with constantly cold feet, and you know how to knit? Make them a set of kitten mittens!

> **Do you really need my phone number?**  
I know, I feel just as icky asking. Unfortunately, many shipping providers (especially when shipping internationally) request this information, so it dramatically reduces overhead to ask for the info upfront.

> **What if I'm worried that shipping will be super expensive?**  
I'm happy to report that I considered that!  On the form you can set your shipping preferences, limiting to any number of countries or continents.  I can't guarantee that I'll be able to fulfil your preference, but I'll get as close as I can if not!

> **What if "as close as I can" isn't close enough?**  
Anyone who doesn't get a place listed in their choices will also get a heads-up from us to make sure they're still comfortable taking part. If shipping costs are too expensive, you are welcome to step back. 

> **Is Prami Partners a dating site?**  
No ðŸ˜­ I promise the blue and pink hearts are just a coincidence caused by the fact that Prami is pink and Snappy-Tech is blue. Since we're here, please remember not to be weird. Your Prami Partner has trusted you with some personal information, and I'm trusting you to respect that.

> **What if I don't want to hand out my personal info?**  
I get it! We have some digital-only Prami Partners events cooking, which will only require your omg.lol address if you're not comfortable with sharing more information. Keep an eye out for that in the coming months!

> **What will you do with my personal info?**  
Honestly, I don't want to keep hold of it either. Assuming I have no cause to keep ahold of it (disputes over unreceived gifts, for example), it will all be deleted 3 months after entries close.
